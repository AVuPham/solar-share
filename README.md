## ðŸ’» Project Introduction

### a. Overview
Solar Share is a social enterprise initiative designed to promote access to renewable energy in Vietnam through a **technology-based rooftop solar sharing model**.  
It helps householdsâ€”especially in rural and low-income areasâ€”access clean electricity without the need for initial investment, while creating measurable economic, social, and environmental impacts.

### b. Key Features & Function Manual
- **Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS)** model: 3kW rooftop solar system installed per household, paid by monthly rental fees lower than EVN bills.  
- **IoT-based Smart Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of electricity production & usage.  
- **AI Optimization**: Forecasts demand, optimizes energy usage, prevents overload.  
- **P2P Energy Sharing**: Blockchain-ready peer-to-peer electricity trading.  
- **Multi-channel Revenue**: Rental fees, transaction fees, carbon credits, ESG funding.  

### c. Unique Features (Whatâ€™s special about this app?)
- **No upfront cost** barrier for households.  
- **Community-powered energy sharing** model.  
- **Integration with carbon credit market** for sustainability funding.  
- **Scalable business-social model**: from rural Vietnam to ASEAN & Africa.  

### d. Technology Stack and Implementation Methods
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js (planned integration with Blockchain & APIs)  
- **IoT Devices**: Smart meters & solar hub for real-time monitoring  
- **AI**: Demand forecasting, anomaly detection, transaction automation  
- **Blockchain**: Transparent P2P transactions with Smart Contracts  

### e. Service Architecture & Database structure
- **IoT Smart Meters** â†’ Collect energy data â†’ Send to Cloud & AI models  
- **AI Engine** â†’ Forecast demand, optimize consumption, detect fraud  
- **Blockchain Smart Contracts** â†’ Automate secure energy transactions  
- **User Platform (Web/App)** â†’ Manage energy usage, track savings, trade electricity

## ðŸ§  Reflection

### a. If you had more time, what would you expand?
- Build **AI predicting the use of solar energy each household** powered by Solar Share.  
- Build **EV charging station networks** powered by Solar Share.  
- Add **energy storage & green hydrogen production** for resilience.
- Build **Websites and Apps" for Solar Share and SolarMove (the next chap of Solar Share)  

### b. If you integrate AI APIs more for your app, what would you do?
- **Smart Demand Forecasting** per region & household.  
- **Automated Trading Assistant** for P2P energy sharing.  
- **Energy-saving Recommendations** integrated into smart home devices.
